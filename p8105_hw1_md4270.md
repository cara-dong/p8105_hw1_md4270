The variables in this dataset include important variables such as year
and month indicating the data is about weather from January 2013. There
are also temp(temperature at the start of each hour), humid(humidity in
percentage), and visib(visibility) and time_hour (the time that the
temperature is recorded).

Time-related features are mostly in integer form, while the
weather-related features are in double decimal form.

It has 15 columns and 358 rows. The mean temperature is 39.5821229
degree Fahrenheit.

``` r
# plot the scatter plot btw time and temp
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

Patterns I observed:

- Darker blue dots represent lower humidity while lighter blue dots
  represent higher humidity.
- The weather seems to be more humid with higher temperature.
- The humidity increases in oscillation because of the different time in
  the day.
- As time progresses from early January to mid-January, the weather
  becomes more humid.

``` r
# save the scatter plot

## Problem 2

``` r
# a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
rand_samp = rnorm(10)
```

``` r
# a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
logical = rand_samp > 0
```

``` r
# a character vector of length 10
char_vec = vector("character", 10)
```

``` r
# a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
levels = c("Level1", "Level2", "Level3")
factor_vec = factor(rep(levels, length.out=10))
```

``` r
# create a df from the vars above
df = tibble(random_sample = rand_samp, 
            logical_vector = logical,  
            char_vector = char_vec, 
            factor_vector = factor_vec)
df
```

    ##  3       -0.196  FALSE          ""          Level3       
    ##  4        0.314  TRUE           ""          Level1       
    ##  5       -0.474  FALSE          ""          Level2       
    ##  6        0.201  TRUE           ""          Level3       
    ##  7        0.0167 TRUE           ""          Level1

    ## 10       -1.20   FALSE          ""          Level1

Taking the mean of each variable:

``` r
# mean for random numbers vector
random_mean = mean(pull(df, random_sample))
random_mean
```

    ## [1] -0.5579872

``` r
# mean for logical vector
logical_mean = mean(pull(df, logical_vector))
logical_mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
# mean for character vector
char_mean = mean(pull(df, char_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, char_vector)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
char_mean
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
# mean for factor vector
factor_mean = mean(pull(df, factor_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, factor_vector)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
factor_mean
```

    ## [1] NA

Based on the output, taking the mean for random sample vector and
logical vector worked, but those for character and factor vectors did
not work.

Now, we convert the character and factor variable type using as.numeric:

``` r
# convert character vector
char_numeric = as.numeric(char_vec)
char_numeric

# convert factor vector
factor_numeric = as.numeric(factor_vec)
factor_numeric
```

The character vector turns all elements into “NA” and the factor vector
becomes their corresponding levels (numbers from 1 to 3).

The character vectors contains all “NA” because characters/strings
cannot be coalesced to numbers by simply calling a “as.numeric”
function. We might have to unfactor and then convert to numeric to
calculate. This helps explains why we cannot calculate the mean for the
character vector.

The factor vectors contains each element’s corresponding level, which
helps explain why we cannot take its mean because level has an
ordinal/categorical connotation and there is no meaning in taking the
mean of those levels. The elements originally were not numeric or
logical.
